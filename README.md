# 18 NoSQL: Social Network API

## Description

As a developer looking to strengthen my skills, I decided to build out a social media network. In this particular project, I will be working on the back-end in which I will build an API for the network. Here, users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts and create a friends list. I will use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
